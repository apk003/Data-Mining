This was a full-class competition with very generous extra credit. I was not in the top 10 for either leaderboard due to class size, but still got 11/10.

Goal 1: RMSE below 0.76

Goal 2: RMSE125 below 0.96.

RMSE measures the mean Euclidean error between predictions and actual values. RMSE125 is much stricter, as it is measuring RMSE for the extreme values 1, 2, and 5. Lowering RMSE125 without bringing RMSE above the threshold score was the greatest challenge.
