Source code for HW2.

Task 1 - Finds association rules within user IDs. PCY implemented using a simple (though inefficient) one-to-one hash function.

Task 2 - Finds association rules within business IDS. PCY uses a slightly quicker hash function in order to deal with non-numerical IDs.

Data preprocessing script used to create nv_data.csv is omitted, as well as debugging scripts.
